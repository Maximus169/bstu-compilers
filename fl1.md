~~The world was perfect in that moment~~


**Please!**


>I had a dream once>
>All by myself with no one else>
>I thought I'd died and gone to heaven>
>Then I woke up>
>And everybody wanted something>
>Reaching out don't fucking touch me>
>So I take pills to induce sleep>
>But I always wake up>


1. From my heart
2. I hope you know this song is about you
3. From my heart
